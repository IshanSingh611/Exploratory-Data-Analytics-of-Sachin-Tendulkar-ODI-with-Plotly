# Exploratory-Data-Analytics-of-Sachin-Tendulkar-ODI-with-Plotly
Exploratory Data Analytics is an approach, or a philosophy, which seeks to explore the <b>most important and often hidden patterns</b> in a data set. Statisticians use it to take a bird‟s eye view of the data and try to make some sense of it.

Exploratory data analysis helps you, as a data analyst, to look beyond the data. It is a never ending process — the more you explore the data, the more insights you get. Almost 80% of the time, you would spend your time as a data analyst understanding the data and solving various business problems through EDA. If you understand EDA properly, then half the battle is won.

In this Exploratory Data Analytics we use Python Visualization Library - <b>PLOTLY</b>

The plotly Python library is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.plotly enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks

Charts used in this project
- Histogram with Box Plots
  #### In statistics, a histogram is representation of the distribution of numerical data, where the data are binned and the count for each bin is represented.
  #### A box plot is a statistical representation of numerical data through their quartiles. The ends of the box represent the lower and upper quartiles, while the median (second quartile) is marked by a line inside the box
  
- Donut Charts
  #### A Donut chart is a circular statistical chart with a hole in a middle, which is divided into sectors to illustrate numerical proportion.
  
- Plotly Bar plots
  #### bar plots used to show aggregated data such as mean, medium, mode etc & other statistical data in a rectangular mark
  
- Line plots with Sliders
  #### A line plot is a graph that shows frequency of data along a number line
  
- Bar plots with Customize buttons
  #### By using customize buttons you can switch easily from one graph to another to visualize them in single frame
  
- Stacked Bar plots
  #### In a stacked bar chart, parts of the data are adjacent (in the case of horizontal bars) or stacked (in the case of vertical bars, aka columns) each bar displays a total amount, broken down into sub-amounts.
  
- Scatter plot with line plot
  #### A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.
  
- Heatmaps
  #### A heat map (or heatmap) is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by color. Heat maps make it easy to visualize complex data and understand it at a glance
  #### Annotation Added in Heatmaps (Updated version)

- Treemaps
  #### Treemap charts visualize hierarchical data using nested rectangles

## Note
If you found difficulty to view plots this is because of the issue is that github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.
